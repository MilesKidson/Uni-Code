    \section*{Abstract}
    In this project we aim to analyse a system described by a second order differential equation 
    both analytically and numerically. This equation describes a "car on a washboard surface". As 
    the car drives along it oscillates up and down on a damped spring, but the washboard surface 
    makes it much more complicated than that. We will first determine the differential equation, 
    then solve it analytically using the method of Undetermined Coefficients in order to find the 
    velocity at which the car oscillates with greatest amplitude. Then we will simulate the equation 
    numerically to verify our result.


    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Modelling} \newline
        In order to model this system, we must consider all of the forces acting on the car. 
        It's relatively safe to assume that the car is in an inertial reference frame, therefore 
        we know that $\vec{F}_{net}=m\vec{a}$. On the other hand, we know that the only forces 
        acting on the car are the force of gravity $\vec{F}_G = m\vec{g}$ and the force of the 
        "spring", which can be modelled as $\vec{F}_S = k\Delta \vec{y}$ where $\Delta \vec{y}$ 
        is the distance from the equilibrium position to the current position of the mass.
        Now if we consider the system when it's at rest, in other words when the spring is at a 
        relative equilibrium position, there is a force being applied on the car by the spring in 
        order to perfectly balance the force of gravity, in which case we can effectively ignore 
        the force of gravity and choose the new position from which to measure $\Delta \vec{y}$, 
        leaving us with

        \begin{equation*}
            \vec{F}_{net} = k\Delta \vec{y}
        \end{equation*}

        Now we must consider the dashpot, which applies a force on the mass in proportion to 
        the velocity of the mass in the form $\vec{F}_D = c\vec{v}$. Adding this into our 
        equation for $\vec{F_{net}}$, we find 

        \begin{equation*}
            \vec{F}_{net} = k\Delta \vec{y} + c\vec{v}
        \end{equation*}

        With a usual mass on a spring system, this is as far as it goes as the only thing that 
        moves is the mass, but in this case both the mass and the connection point of the 
        "spring" are moving and they're not necessarily moving in sync with each other. In 
        order to account for this we need to modify the $\Delta\vec{y}$ and $\vec{v}$ terms 
        as they will not be changing in a simple manner. For the $\Delta\vec{y}$ term, this 
        isn't too hard to do. We just need to consider the effect that different values of 
        $\Delta\vec{y}$ will have on $\vec{F}_S$. From this we find 

        \begin{equation*}
            \vec{F}_S = k(y(t) - Y(t))
        \end{equation*}

        where $Y(t)$ is the upward displacement of the car and $y(t)$ is the upward displacement 
        of the connection point of the "spring", given by 

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                y(t) &= a\sin\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} \\
                &= a\sin\frac{2\pi v t}{\lambda}
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}

        as $x = vt$. Now to consider the $\vec{F}_D$ term. Through some careful consideration 
        of the force depending on which way the mass and the connection point are moving, we 
        can find that 

        \begin{equation*}
            \vec{F}_D = c(\dot{y}(t) - \dot{Y}(t))
        \end{equation*}

        Putting this all together, we can see that 

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                \vec{F}_{net} &= k(y - Y) + c(\dot{y} - \dot{Y}) \\
                m\vec{a} &= k(y - Y) + c(\dot{y} - \dot{Y}) \\
                m\ddot{Y} &= ky - kY + c\dot{y} - c\dot{Y}
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}

        and finally 

        \begin{equation}
            m\ddot{Y} + c\dot{Y} + kY = ky + c\dot{y}
            \label{eqn:differential equation}
        \end{equation}

        which is the final form of the equation of motion we are looking for.

        \item \textbf{Analysis} \newline
        In order to analyse this differential equation we first need to recognise 
        that it's a non-homogeneous second order linear ODE. This means that we can 
        find the general solution to the homogeneous equation and a particular solution 
        to the non-homogeneous equation and thus we will have found the general 
        solution to the non-homogeneous equation. 
        \newline
        Firstly, the general solution to the homogeneous equation 

        \begin{equation}
            m\ddot{Y}+c\dot{Y}+kY=0
            \label{eqn:homogeneous equation}
        \end{equation}

        \noindent
        can be found by firstly finding the roots of the characteristic equation 
        
        \begin{equation}
            mr^2+cr+k=0
            \label{eqn:homogeneous characteristic}
        \end{equation}
        
        which are $r_{1,2}=-\frac{5}{4}\pm i\sqrt{\frac{1375}{16}}$. Using the general formula for 
        the solution to a second order linear homogeneous equation
        
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{gathered}
                r_{1,2} = a+bi \\
                y_g = e^{at}(C1\cos(bt)+C2\sin(bt))
            \end{gathered}
            \label{eqn:gen formula homo soln}
        \end{equation}

        we find 

        \begin{equation}
            Y_{hg} = e^{-\frac{5t}{4}}(C1\cos(pt)+C2\sin(pt))
            \label{eqn:homogeneous gen sol 1}
        \end{equation}

        where $p = \sqrt{\frac{1375}{16}}$. $C1$ and $C2$ are determined from initial conditions, which 
        for this problem are relatively insignificant, so we've chosen $Y(0)=0.2$ and $\dot{Y}(0)=1$. By 
        differentiating Equation (\ref{eqn:homogeneous gen sol 1}) and substituting those initial conditions, 
        we find that $C1=0.2$ and $C2=\frac{\sqrt{55}}{55}$, resulting in
        
        \begin{equation}
            Y_{hg} = e^{-\frac{5t}{4}}(0.2\cos(pt)+\frac{\sqrt{55}}{55}\sin(pt))
            \label{eqn:homogeneous gen sol 2}
        \end{equation}

        Now, in order to find a general solution to the non-homogeneous equation we must find any 
        particular solution to it and sum it with Equation (\ref{eqn:homogeneous gen sol 2}). To do 
        this, we can use the method of Undetermined Coefficients, starting with a guessed solution. 
        In our case we guess that $Y = A\sin(\frac{2\pi v}{\lambda}t)$ and substitute it into Equation 
        (\ref{eqn:differential equation}) resulting in 

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{gathered}
                -mz^2[A\sin(zt)+B\cos(zt)]+cz[A\cos(zt)-B\sin(zt)] \\
                +k[A\sin(zt)+B\cos(zt)]=caz\cos(zt)+ka\sin(zt)
            \end{gathered}
        \end{equation*}

        where $z=\frac{\pi v}{5}$. Simplifying this we find 

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{gathered}
                \sin(zt)[A(k-mz^2)-B(cz)]+\cos(zt)[B(k-mz^2)+A(cz)] \\
                =\sin(zt)(ka)+\cos(zt)(caz)
            \end{gathered}
        \end{equation*}

        From the coefficients of the $\cos$'s and $\sin$'s we can extract a system of equations, which we 
        can solve to find $A$ and $B$:

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                ka &= A(k-mz^2)-B(cz) \\
                caz &= A(cz)+B(k-mz^2) \\
                \implies A &= \frac{k^2a-mkaz^2+ac^2z^2}{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}; \\
                B &= \frac{camz^3}{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}

        So we have found a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation, and thus the general 
        solution to the differential equation, which is 

        \begin{equation}
            \begin{gathered}
                Y_g = e^{-\frac{5t}{4}}(0.2\cos(pt)+\frac{\sqrt{55}}{55}\sin(pt)) \\
                +\frac{k^2a-mkaz^2+ac^2z^2}{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}\sin(zt)+\frac{camz^3}{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}\cos(zt)
            \end{gathered}
            \label{eqn:non-homogeneous gen sol}
        \end{equation}
        
        where, as before, $a=0.05, c=\num{2e3}, k=\num{7e4}, m=800, p=\sqrt{\frac{1375}{16}}$, and 
        $z=\frac{\pi v}{5}$.
        \newline
        Now, in order to find out the velocity that maximises the amplitude of oscillations we need to 
        substitute some things in and rearrange the equation to give us a term we can maximise. 
        The two terms from $y_{hg}$ don't have any impact past the transient stage as the 
        $e^{\frac{-5t}{4}}$ term goes to 0 as $t$ increases. So we have to maximise the second and 
        third terms. Firstly, we can define two things:

        \begin{equation*}
            \sin(\alpha) = \frac{k^2-mka^2+a^2z^2}{\sqrt{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}};\hspace{5pt} \cos(\alpha) = \frac{cmz^3}{\sqrt{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}}
        \end{equation*}
        
        Now we can simplify Equation (\ref{eqn:non-homogeneous gen sol}), ignoring $y_{hg}$ to find

        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                Y_g &= \frac{a}{\sqrt{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}}\left[\cos(zt)\cos(\alpha)+\sin(zt)\sin(\alpha)\right] \\
                &= \frac{a}{\sqrt{(k-mz^2)^2+c^2z^2}}\cdot\cos(zt-\alpha)
            \end{split}
            \label{eqn:max amplitude soln}
        \end{equation}

        This gives us a nice term to maximise, namely by minimising the denominator. The $(cz)^2$ 
        term can never be zero, apart from the trivial case where $v=0$ as $z=\frac{\pi v}{5}$, so 
        we minimise $(k-mz^2)$:

        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                k-mz^2=&0 \\
                \implies z=&\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \\
                \implies v=&\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\cdot\frac{5}{\pi} \\
                v\approx&14.88758171
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}

        And that is the value of $v$ for which the oscillations have a maximum amplitude. To find 
        that amplitude we can plot Equation (\ref{eqn:max amplitude soln}) using Python and extract the 
        maximum amplitude. Below in Figure (\ref{fig:analytical}) we have plotted the amplitude of 
        oscillations for various values of $v$. This has a shape very similar to a resonance curve 
        and peaks at $v \approx 14.6573$ with a value of $A \approx 0.1952$.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \begin{center}
                \scalebox{.7}{\input{Analytical Plot.pgf}}
                \caption{Analytical Plot}
                \label{fig:analytical}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        \item \textbf{Numerical Simulation} \newline
        To verify the result above we can simulate the original differential equation in Equation 
        (\ref{eqn:differential equation}) using \texttt{scipy.integrate.odeint}. Following the 
        documentation and extracting the amplitude for each value of $v \in [1, 30]$ with $dv \approx 0.5$ 
        we get the plot in Figure (\ref{fig:numerical}), with its peak at $v \approx 14.6573$ with 
        $A \approx 0.1952$.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \begin{center}
               \scalebox{.7}{\input{The Numerical Plot.pgf}}
               \caption{Numerical Plot}
               \label{fig:numerical}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        This agrees with our simulation of the solution but not with the analytical solution for $v$, 
        which is strange but most likely a rounding error in the simulation. 
        
    \end{enumerate}

    \section*{Conclusion}
    To conclude, we found that the system we were analysing acts in some ways like we would expect, 
    having a resonance curve that's very regular when looking at the amplitude of oscillations with 
    respect to the velocity of the car. We also found that the velocity at which the amplitude was 
    greatest was $\approx 14.89$.
