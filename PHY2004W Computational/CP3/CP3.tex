    \section{Introduction}
    This computational activity was an introduction into the world of numerical integration, 
    which is one of the methods that we can use to solve differential equations, something 
    that we have to do quite often in physics as we are often solving second order ordinary 
    differential equations that come out of applying Newton's second law. This is often 
    reduced to two coupled equations:

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}
        \hspace{15pt}
        \textrm{and}
        \hspace{15pt}
        \frac{d\vec{q}}{dt} = \frac{\vec{p}}{m}
        \label{eq:newton}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    where $\vec{p}$ is a momentum, $\vec{F}$ is a net force, $\vec{q}$ is a coordinate, 
    and $m$ is a mass. 
    \newline
    In order to numerically solve these equations, we approximate the derivatives, which 
    results in 2 equations, which we call update equations:

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            &\vec{p}(t+\Delta t) = \vec{p}(t)+\vec{F}(\vec{q}(t))\Delta t \\
            &\vec{q}(t+\Delta t) = \vec{q}(t)+\left(\frac{\vec{p}(t)}{m}\right)\Delta t 
        \end{split}
        \label{eq:update}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    These are what we will use in this Activity in order to approximate the motion of, in 
    this case, a simple pendulum. These equations are very tedious to evaluate for all t, 
    but that's where the computer comes in. 

    \section{Activity}
    The first thing that we need to do is check the accuracy of these equations (\ref{eq:update}). 
    In order to do this, we perform a Taylor expansion of $y(t+\Delta t)$, truncating after 
    only 2 terms, a first order approximation, making the error small, but still significant:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            y(t+\Delta t) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{y^{(n)}(t)\Delta t^n}{n!} \\
            &= y(t) + \dot{y}(t) \Delta t + \ddot{y}(t) \Delta t^2 + \dots
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    \noindent
    When truncating this at the second term, this gives us something of the form of the 
    equation for $\vec{p}$ in Equation \ref{eq:update}, which confirms that we are using 
    first order approximations in this activity. 
    \newline
    For the sake of interest, we can try to get a second order approximation of the first 
    derivative. For the sake of computation, we have approximated the derivative to be 

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{dy}{dt} \approx \frac{y(t+\Delta t) - y(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    From this, we can substitute in a second order approximation for $y(t+\Delta t)$, 
    which returns

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \frac{dy}{dt} &\approx \frac{y(t) + \dot{y}(t) \Delta t + \ddot{y}(t) \Delta t^2 - y(t)}{\Delta t} \\
            &= \dot{y}(t) + \ddot{y}(t) \Delta t
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    We see that this gives us something of the form of the equation for $\vec{q}$ in 
    Equation \ref{eq:update}.
    \newline
    Next, we need to create the model that we will be using to simulate the system of 
    interest. In its most complete form, the equation of motion for a pendulum is:

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+\Omega_0^2\sin\theta = 0 
        \label{eq:pendulum}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    where $\Omega_0^2 = \frac{g}{L}$, $\theta$ is the angle from the vertical, and $L$ is the 
    length of the pendulum. This equation comes from an analysis of the forces on the system. 
    We know that the torque $\tau = I\alpha$, where $I = mL^2$ is the moment of inertia for a pendulum 
    with a massless string and $\alpha = \ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration. Then, by 
    equating all the forces, we get

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            &\tau = I\alpha = mL^2\ddot{\theta} \\
            \textrm{Equating forces:}\hspace{5pt} &mL^2\ddot{\theta} = -mg\sin\theta L \\
            \implies &\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta = 0 \\
        \end{split}
        \label{eq:pendulum derivation}
    \end{equation*}

    \noindent
    In order to simplify this, we can take what we call a small angle approximation, where 
    $\sin\theta = \theta$ for angles $<\sim\ang{10}$. This leads us to the equation 

    \begin{equation}
        \ddot{\theta} = -\Omega_0^2 \theta
        \label{eq:SHM}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    which we know is the general form for a simple harmonic oscillator.
    \newline
    \newline
    Now, going back to Equation \ref{eq:pendulum derivation}, if we let 
    $\Omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$, then we get the equation as in (\ref{eq:pendulum}). More 
    manipulation will lead to a coupled form of this equation:

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d\omega}{dt}=-\Omega_0^2 \sin\theta 
        \hspace{15pt}
        \textrm{and}
        \hspace{15pt}
        \frac{d\theta}{dt}=\omega
        \label{eq:coupled pendulum}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    Given the initial conditions of $\theta(0)=\ang{90}, \omega(0)=0$, we interpret this as the 
    pendulum being held at \ang{90} to the vertical and at rest (angular velocity $\omega = 0$), 
    then let go. In the small angle approximation, the system should oscillate with an angular 
    frequency of $\Omega_0^2$, but these initial conditions do not satisfy the small angle 
    approximation, so we will need another method in order to figure out what the motion of the 
    system will look like, for example numerical integration. 
    \newline
    \newline
    In order to perform this numerical integration, we need to have some equations in the form 
    of Equation \ref{eq:update}, which we can adapt to have the following:

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            &p_{i+1} = p_i - \Omega_0^2 \sin(q_i) \Delta t \\
            &q_{i+1} = q_i + p_i \Delta t
        \end{split}
        \label{eq:pendulum update}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    where $i=0,1,2\dots$ and $q \equiv \theta, p \equiv \omega$.
    \newline
    We can do this because we got the equations for the motion of the pendulum into a similar 
    form in Equation \ref{eq:coupled pendulum} as in Equation \ref{eq:update}. This is known 
    as Euler's Method and is a commonly used method for numerically solving systems that are 
    hard or impossible to solve analytically. Now we can begin to implement this in Python in 
    order for the computer to do the heavy lifting. 
    \newline
    \newline
    The entire code for this calculation is in Appendix 1 but the most important part is the 
    loop we use a loop to continuously update the values of $\theta$ and $\omega$, appending 
    them to an array so that we can plot them later on, which can be seen below.
    \newline
        
    \lstinputlisting[title=Euler's Method Loop, style=inline, linerange=25-29, firstnumber=25]{CP3a.py}
    
    \noindent
    We also calculate a value for the total energy of the system at each step, the equation 
    for which is 

    \begin{equation}
        E = E_K + E_P = \frac{1}{2}mL^2 \omega^2 + mgL(1-\cos\theta)
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    In this case, we are not given a value for the mass or the length of the pendulum, so 
    we assume them to be 1 as this shouldn't affect the shape of the plot, just the scale 
    of it. Below is the first plot [Figure \ref{fig:CP390}] which has initial conditions 
    of $\theta = \ang{90}$ and $\omega = 0$. This clearly does not satisfy the conditions 
    for a small angle approximation, and thus at around 6.5s, the plots go haywire, with 
    $\theta$ and $\omega$ becoming only negative, which is not a natural way for this 
    system to behave.

           \label{fig:CP310}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \newpage\noindent
    Figure \ref{fig:CP310} is another plot of the same thing, except with a initial 
    angle of \ang{10}. This is well within the small angle approximation conditions and thus 
    it seems to behave somewhat naturally, oscillating around $\theta, \omega = 0$.
    \newline
    \newline
    The plot on the bottom left of the Figure is what we call a phase plot, effectively plotting 
    the position of the bob against the velocity of the bob. It reveals information about the 
    solution to the differential equation that describes the motion we're considering. In this 
    case, for the two plots above, we notice that the solution is periodic in some sense but 
    seems to be spiralling out of control, which we can attribute to the increasing amplitude 
    of the oscillations. It's also clear that energy is not being conserved, which we will 
    discuss next.
    \newline
    Firstly, $\theta$ seems to increase in amplitude as time goes on, as well as $\omega$. 
    This obviously has an effect on the energy of the system, which seems to be increasing 
    at some kind of exponential rate. It becomes obvious that the reason for this is rounding 
    errors in the code when we change $\Delta t$ to be 0.001, rather than its initial value of 
    0.01, producing the plots below in Figure \ref{fig:CP310b}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
           \scalebox{.7}{\input{CP3 10b.pgf}}
           \caption{Plotting values for Small $\theta$ with $\Delta t = 0.001$}
           \label{fig:CP310b}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    \noindent
    Here we can see that, while energy isn't conserved entirely, it's doing a much better 
    job of it than it was in the previous example. We can also observe that the phase plot is 
    much more elliptical and therefore purely periodic, which we expect when analysing a pendulum 
    oscillating with small $\theta$. In order to analytically prove that the energy increases 
    with each step when looking at small angle approximations, we look at Equation \ref{eq:coupled pendulum}:

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            &p_{i+1} = p_i - \Omega_0^2 \sin(q_i) \Delta t \\
            &q_{i+1} = q_i + p_i \Delta t \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{center}
        At small angles we can approximate
    \end{center}
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            &\sin\theta = \theta \\
            &(1-\cos\theta) = 1 \\
            \implies &p_{i+1} = p_i - \Omega_0^2 q_i \Delta t \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{center}
        Now recall
    \end{center}
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            &E = \frac{1}{2}mL^2 \omega^2 + mgL(1-\cos\theta) \\
            \implies &E = \frac{1}{2}mL^2 \omega^2 + mgL
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    
    \noindent
    It's important to notice that this $E$ depends on $\omega$, which, when calculated 
    in the program, is done so using a Taylor expansion which is truncated after the 
    second term. While this error is not great, when squared and compounded 1000 times 
    as it is in the first two examples, it's obvious that this is the source of the error. 
    The only problem is that this error seems to be coming from a quadratic term, while the 
    increase in energy seems to be exponential, which we can't seem to make sense of. 
    \newline
    \newline
    One solution to the energy conservation problem is an adjustment to the method we use 
    to approximate the values of, in this case, $\omega$ and $\theta$. The equations are 
    valid for the entire interval of interest and so we can evaluate a point later in time 
    in order to better approximate the derivative of the function of interest. This is an 
    improvement to the Euler's method that we have been using and it doesn't quite solve the 
    issue of energy not being conserved, but it does give a bound to the energy, making it 
    periodic. This method is known as Symplectic Integration or the Symplectic Euler Method.
    Below, Figure \ref{fig:symplectic}, is the set of plots for this method.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
           \scalebox{.7}{\input{CP3b 10.pgf}}
           \caption{Symplectic Integration Method with $\theta$ small}
           \label{fig:symplectic}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    \noindent
    The code for this entire section is in Appendix 2 and it can be seen that it is practically 
    identical to the first section with the exception of the loop, which can be seen below.
    \newline
    \lstinputlisting[title=Symplectic Euler's Method Loop, style=inline, linerange=25-29, firstnumber=25]{CP3b.py}
    
    \noindent
    As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:symplectic}, this method is much better at keeping the 
    energy bounded, with a total variation of $\sim 0.2$. Compared to the previous results, 
    this is a great improvement in terms of accurately approximating the motion. We can again 
    notice that the phase plot is purely elliptical, with no decay or growth, showing that our 
    energy is conserved to some extent. We have effectively removed the approximation from the 
    calculation, rather approximating the entire problem but accurately calculating the values. 
    \newline
    \newline
    Finally, we will investigate the dependence of period on either the amplitude or the length. 
    In our case, we will investigate length. In order to do this, we have written some code, 
    Appendix 3, that is in most senses the exact same as the first two sections with a few extra 
    arrays and calculations added. Most importantly, we added an extra loop so that we can simulate 
    the motion of the pendulum for a range of different lengths, namely 1m to 100m, evaluating every 
    metre. From this, we performed a Levenberg-Marquardt fit using the \texttt{curve\_fit} function 
    in \texttt{scipy.optimize} and could then extract the angular frequency and from that find the 
    period. Below are the most important lines from the code.
    \newline
    \lstinputlisting[title=Length Dependence of Period Code, style=inline, linerange=32-41, firstnumber=32]{CP3c.py}
    
    \noindent
    Line 40 is the calculation of the observed period and line 41 is a calculation of the expected 
    period given the angular frequency $\Omega_0$ supplied in line 37. Below, Figure \ref{fig:lengthperiod90}, 
    is the plot of the observed period and the predicted period. Importantly, the predicted period is 
    based off the small angle approximation, where $T = \frac{2\pi}{\Omega_0}$.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
           \scalebox{.7}{\input{CP3c 90.pgf}}
           \caption{Length Dependence of Period with Starting $\theta = \ang{90}$}
           \label{fig:lengthperiod90}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent
    As can be seen, the prediction underestimates the period by an increasingly significant amount. 
    However, when oscillating at small angles, as below in Figure \ref{fig:lengthperiod10}, the 
    small angle approximation predicts the length dependence of period quite accurately. It might not 
    be very visible but the two plots are practically on top of one another.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
           \scalebox{.7}{\input{CP3c 10.pgf}}
           \caption{Length Dependence of Period with Starting $\theta = \ang{10}$}
           \label{fig:lengthperiod10}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    \noindent
    From these two results we can conclude that at small angles Euler's Method, when using Symplectic 
    Integration, is quite good at modelling something like an simple oscillator. However, when 
    deviating slightly from the bounds of the small angle approximation, these numerical methods 
    do well but are not accurate enough to trust entirely.
    \newline
