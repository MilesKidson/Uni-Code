    \section{Introduction and Aim}
    In this assignment we investigated the Monte Carlo method, a way of simulating systems by 
    use of random numbers. We revisited some data from a previous assignment and created our 
    own version of the data to analyse.

    \section{Activity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Histogramming Data}\newline
        Firstly, we had a look back at some data from CP1, namely Activity1Data.txt, a list 
        of 60 values generated with a certain mean ($\mu=40$) and standard deviation ($\sigma=2$) 
        using a Monte Carlo method. We plotted these values on a histogram (Appendix 1) and plotted 
        the gaussian based on a $\mu$ and $\sigma$ calculated from the data itself. We also plotted 
        the expected gaussian given the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ used to generate the data. 
        
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \begin{center}
                \scalebox{.7}{\input{Activity1DataHist.pgf}}
                \caption{Activity1Data Histogram and Gaussians}
                \label{fig:Activity1DataHist}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}
        
        \noindent
        Before scaling, the histogram was much larger than the gaussian as the area under a gaussian 
        distribution is always 1, whereas the histogram doesn't necessarily have an area of 1. To 
        resolve this and make the graph more readable, we set the density argument to True when 
        creating the histogram, which normalises it, giving us the graph above. 
        \newline
        Now, looking at the Actual Gaussian compared to the Expected Gaussian in Figure 
        (1), we see that they're a bit different, in fact the actual 
        gaussian peaks slightly higher than the expected one. This is probably because the method 
        of generating data isn't perfect so we can expect slight variations from dataset to dataset. 
        We will investigate this further in the next section.

        \item \textbf{Generating Random Numbers}\newline
        Next, we created some of our own data to analyse in the same way (Appendix 2). Below is an 
        example of the file we created to analyse.
        \newline
        \lstinputlisting[title=Randomised Data, style=inline, linerange=1-4, firstnumber=1]{RandomisedData.txt}
        
        Doing exactly the same analysis as before, we have the plots in Figure (\ref{fig:RandomDataHistograms60}), 
        an example of 2 different datasets created from the same initial conditions.

        \begin{figure}[H]%
            \centering
            \subfloat{\scalebox{0.45}{\input{RandomisedDataHist60_1.pgf}}}%
            \qquad
            \subfloat{\scalebox{0.45}{\input{RandomisedDataHist60_2.pgf}}}%
            \caption{60 Random points with specific $\mu$ and $\sigma$}
            \label{fig:RandomDataHistograms60}
        \end{figure}
        
        \noindent
        As can be seen, the mean still sits at around 40 but due to the different distributions of 
        the random numbers used to create the data it's never exactly 40. It is likely that if we 
        were to increase the number of random numbers, we would get a more accurate mean, as well as 
        a consistently more accurate gaussian plot. Below in Figure (\ref{fig:RandomDataHistograms600}) 
        is the exact same program but with 10 times as many data points. Clearly this gives more 
        accurate results.

        \begin{figure}[H]%
            \centering
            \subfloat{\scalebox{0.45}{\input{RandomisedDataHist600_1.pgf}}}%
            \qquad
            \subfloat{\scalebox{0.45}{\input{RandomisedDataHist600_2.pgf}}}%
            \caption{60 Random points with specific $\mu$ and $\sigma$}
            \label{fig:RandomDataHistograms600}
        \end{figure}

        \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Determination of $\pi$}\newline
        Finally, to see what else Monte Carlo simulations can do, we tried to determine an approximation 
        of $\pi$. To do this, we generated a number of random coordinates within a 2 $\times$ 2 square 
        around the origin. Statistically, these points should distribute evenly around the square, 
        but if we check which ones fall within a circle of radius 1 centred on the origin and divide 
        it by the number that fall within the square, which is all of them, we should have 
        $\frac{\pi}{4}$, the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the square. Finally we 
        multiply that number by 4 to find and approximation of $\pi$. All of this code is in 
        Appendix 3 which, after 1 run with 100000 random coordinates, gave a value of $\pi = 3.13924$. 
        \newline
        We can improve the accuracy of this number by running the program many times and taking the 
        mean. We can also increase the number of random coordinates as this will increase the "resolution" 
        of the circle that we're measuring the area of, increasing the accuracy of the approximation.
        We will also find a standard deviation which would be our uncertainty for this value. So we ran 
        the program from before 10000 times, producing the plot in Figure (\ref{fig:ApproxPi}) with 
        a value of $\pi = 3.1416 \pm 0.0052$
        
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \begin{center}
               \scalebox{.7}{\input{ApproxPi1.pgf}}
               \caption{Monte Carlo Approximation of $\pi$}
               \label{fig:ApproxPi}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}
        
        \noindent
        To compare the effect of multiple runs to the effect of more coordinates, we ran it 100 times with 
        10000000 coordinates, giving us a value of $\pi = $. The two runs effectively had the same number 
        of evaluations, or data points, but clearly having a "higher resolution" gives a more accurate 
        approximation when looking at the uncertainty of our approximation alone, as well as when 
        comparing our number to the known value of $\pi = 3.14159265$.
